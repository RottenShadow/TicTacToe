# Features

* **2-Players Mode** : Compete against your friends and choose "X" or "O" to determine the winner!

* **1-Player Mode** : AI Implementation with Minimax Algorithm
The AI opponent leverages the Minimax algorithm, a decision-making algorithm used in game theory to minimize the possible loss in a worst-case scenario. This algorithm ensures that the AI makes optimal moves while considering the player's potential responses.

* ## **Difficulty Levels**:

* **1. Easy** : The AI makes random moves with minimal strategic consideration. It occasionally utilizes the Minimax algorithm, but randomness affects its decision-making, allowing players to win more easily.
<br/><br/>**Suitable for beginners**, this level helps players familiarize themselves with the game mechanics without high pressure.

* **2. Medium** : The AI employs a balanced approach, using the Minimax algorithm more effectively while still incorporating randomization. This creates an unpredictable element, challenging players to think     strategically.
<br/><br/>**Ideal for players with some experience**, this level offers a moderate challenge as the AI starts to block potential wins while making more calculated moves.

* **3. Hard** : The AI fully utilizes the Minimax algorithm, executing optimal moves without any randomization. This level represents an unbeatable opponent, capable of anticipating player moves and blocking winning combinations effectively.
<br/><br/>**Designed for testing purposes**, as the AI will never make any mistake and will actively seek to win.
